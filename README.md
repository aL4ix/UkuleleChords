# UkuleleChords

This repo contains Ukulele chord generation using the fretboard library.
It generate the fretboards with finger positions and tags by chord type and "notes" to generate an Anki deck https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/47647706.
So far it contains major, minor, 7th, maj7 and m7, 6th chords (thanks @untypedjay), and accidentals, in the future I might add more as I learn them.
If you want to contribute, let me know :)

I created this Anki deck since I'm learning Ukulele and kept forgetting the chords. I didn't see any deck that showed finger positions and had tags to allow me to filter the chords (I'm not interested in learning all chords yet, I'm a beginner yet!).
I double checked all chords to see they were correct, but if I made any mistake let me know so we can have the correct version of the chords!
I noticed specially for maj7 and m7 there are different versions, I picked the ones, as a beginner, I thought were the easiest (specially avoiding bars), if you think there is an easier version for a chord let me know! :)
Anyway, any comment, feedback, code change, I'm open to suggestions.
Now let's memorize these chords!
